## In the Nix of Time: A new approach to Shiny development & deployment with Nix and {rix}

Abstract 

The Shiny framework has brought tremendous innovation to data science for R and Python users across many industries. As Shiny applications grow in complexity, developers will encounter unique challenges as they enter the world of software engineering such as managing application and system dependencies, ensuring all developers use the same development environments, and leveraging automation for production deployments. A perfectly valid combination to address these challenges is using `{renv}` to manage R package dependencies and Docker/Podman to handle system-level dependencies. In recent years, the Nix package manager has emerged as an appealing framework to manage the full dependency "stack" of software projects, albeit with a rather steep learning curve. In this talk, I'll share how the new `{rix}` package (authored by Bruno Rodriguez and Phlipp Baumann) has turbo-boosted my Shiny development workflow, empowering me to rapidly iterate on new ideas while ensuring reproducibility across prototyping and production deployments.
