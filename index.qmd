:::

## What is Nix?

* At heart: Nix is a package manager
* Myth 1: Nix is an entire operating system
    * That is NixOS
    * You can use Nix on most Linux distributions, Mac OS X, Windows via WSL
* Not a full container, not a full VM

::: {.notes}
Mention history of Nix (founder, their dissertation)
:::

## Advantages over containers

* Less overhead
* Still feels like native use of OS
* No need for volume mounts

## A Few Papercuts remain

* Compiles from source for package versions not available in a binary cache
* Disk space usage could be an issue on lower-spec hardware
* Debugging Nix errors can be on the cryptic side

## Why for Shiny?

* It's never just Shiny ...
* Manage dependencies not just at the R level
* Support multi-lingual projects
